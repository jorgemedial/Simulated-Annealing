# Simulated Annealing

Simulated Annealing is an optimization algorithm that is specially useful for non-convex functions. 
This example project demonstrate how the [simulated annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing)  algorithm is implemented and may be used to find global maximum of function with a large search space -- or configuration space -- in a heuristic way.

## How it works

## Examples

Three cases are shown: a convex function with one local maximum in a 2-dimensional space, a function with two local maximum in a 2-dimensional space and a highly non-convex function in a N-dimensional space.

### Convex function: 

The simplest case would be a function with only one maximum, the global maximum. This way, there is no risk of obtaining a non-optimal solution
